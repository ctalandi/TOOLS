## Notebook used to control the HYROGFD data set extracted from ANHA4 on the CREG025.L75 grid and compared to Dai et al. one<br>
>
> The overall HYDRO product has the same order of magnitude than Dai et al. with more IA variability <br>
> This has been done on Datarmor: /home1/datahome/ctalandi/DEV/FREDY/CONFIGS/CREG025.L75/HYDROGFD-RUNOFF <br>
> It relies on the CREG025.L75_domain_cfg.nc input grid file and few output time-series are available under the DATA directory<br>
> The HydroGFD runoffs have been spread on the CREG12.L75 grid <br>
