## Notebook used to control the ISBA data set remapping on the CREG025.L75 grid and compared to Dai et al. one<br>
>
> The overall ISBA undersetimate the freshwater flux in the Arctic basin as shown on the figure below<br>
> Moreover when controling sub-areas, is seems that the remapping over the Eurasian area is not done properly, need to check that <br>
> This has been done on Datarmor: /home1/datahome/ctalandi/DEV/FREDY/CONFIGS/CREG025.L75/ISBA-RUNOFF <br>
> It relies on the CREG025.L75_domain_cfg.nc input grid file and few output time-series are available under the DATA directory<br>
