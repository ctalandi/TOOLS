## Scripts used to perform the DFS5.2 forcing interpolation onthe CREG025.L75 grid <br>
>
> Job_interp_dfs5.2.pbs: <br>
> The current scripts used are located there /home1/datawork/ctalandi/WTOOLS/tools/WEIGHTS<br>
> But it would work with more recent version located there: /home1/datahome/ctalandi/DEV/GITREP/DCM_4.0/DCMTOOLS/NEMOREF/nemo_4.2.0/tools/WEIGHTS <br>
> Except that for the interpolation step, need to fill the namelist name file by hand since passing it by argument does not work because of not having defined the ARGC at the coimpilation step. <br>
