The use of the fmask is a mistake, it should be the tmask since this allows 
to skip the vorticity value at the coast when applying the Shapiro filter

Then I changed it a bit to use the fmask instead tmask and also to mask 
other spurious valeus of the wind curl that makes the Shapiro calculation 
with weird values
